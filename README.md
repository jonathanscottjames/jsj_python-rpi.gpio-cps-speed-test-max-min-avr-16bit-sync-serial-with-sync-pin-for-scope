version 6  is a single file that only requiered rpi.gio 
it has a pygame gui and user adjustable threw the up and down arrow keys plus gpio2 input diplay as well as clock out on gpio3 and a scope can use gpio4 as a sweep trigger
previous versions are obscelete  . thanks
# jsj_python-rpi.gpio-cps-speed-test-max-min-avr-16bit-sync-serial-with-sync-pin-for-scope
python terminal text output counts how many times it can turn gpio3 on and off 16times in 1 second also send a sync pulse on gpio4 every 16 cycles so you can watc on you scope. and it tabulates max, min, and average number of 16 clock cycle bursts.. send text output to python terminal.. my pi with beer can coat hanger heat sync indicated about 15000 16 bit serial transfers will be possible when i connect the synchronous serial gyro and barometer gps and thermometer parietal boards to the pi and network it threw the long range wifi connected to it's usb ctrl "c" to exit
